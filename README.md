As part of my efforts to summarize and explain this fascinating course in the {incoming article} for KDnuggets, I have curated all the Jupyter notebooks used throughout the course right here, to serve as a valuable resource for your learning journey.

In these notebooks, you will find the provided code examples, exercises, and solutions of the prompt engineering course.
They will allow you to learn, experiment, and understand the concepts at your own pace.

Please note that these notebooks are intended to be used alongside the course for a more immersive and hands-on learning experience.

You can access the free course at the following link:
